# Current Task: Initial Project Documentation Setup

## Current Objectives
1.  Complete the initial setup of essential documentation files within the `cline_docs` folder as per the project's custom instructions.
2.  Establish a baseline for project tracking and technical decision-making.

## Relevant Context
*   The main project `README.md` has been created, providing a high-level overview of ECP.
*   `cline_docs/projectRoadmap.md` has been created, detailing the long-term goals and phases for ECP development. This corresponds to the overall project plan.
*   We are currently in the initial phase of setting up the project structure and documentation.

## Next Steps
1.  **Create `cline_docs/techStack.md`:**
    *   This document will outline key technology choices and architectural decisions.
    *   Initially, it might be sparse, as many technical decisions for ECP are pending research (Phase 1 of `projectRoadmap.md`).
    *   We can include placeholders for future decisions regarding:
        *   Primary development languages for reference implementations (e.g., Python, JavaScript).
        *   Data formats for ECP specification (e.g., JSON Schema, EBNF for syntax).
        *   Tools for documentation and community (e.g., Sphinx, MkDocs, GitHub Pages, Discourse).
        *   Testing frameworks for LLM capability analysis.

2.  **Create `cline_docs/codebaseSummary.md`:**
    *   This document will provide an overview of the project structure and significant components.
    *   Initially, it will reflect the documentation-focused structure.
    *   Sections to include:
        *   `cline_docs` Overview: Purpose of each document.
        *   Core Project Files: `README.md`, `draft.txt`.
        *   (Placeholders for future code components, data flow, external dependencies).

3.  **Update `cline_docs/projectRoadmap.md`:**
    *   Mark the task "Initial `README.md` created for the project" as completed: `- [x] Initial README.md created for the project.`
    *   Add new tasks for the creation of `projectRoadmap.md` and `currentTask.md` and mark them as completed.
        *   `- [x] cline_docs/projectRoadmap.md created.`
        *   `- [x] cline_docs/currentTask.md created.`
    *   Mark the task "Renamed all instances of UECP to ECP" as completed: `- [x] Renamed all instances of UECP to ECP`

4.  **Proceed with tasks outlined in `projectRoadmap.md` (Phase 1):**
    *   Once initial documentation is set up, the focus will shift to "Phase 1: Foundational Research & Requirements Definition" from the `projectRoadmap.md`. The first actionable sub-task is "1.1 Cross-LLM Capability Analysis".
