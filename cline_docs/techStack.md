# ECP Technology Stack & Architectural Decisions

This document outlines the key technology choices and architectural decisions for the Efficient Communication Profile (ECP) project. As the project is in its early stages, many decisions are pending research and will be updated progressively.

## Core Protocol Design
*   **Underlying Principle:** Leverage structures and logic (math, structured data) inherently understood by most LLMs without requiring model retraining.
*   **Syntax/Format for ECP:** (To be determined in Phase 2.1 of `projectRoadmap.md`)
    *   *Candidates:* JSON-based (with strict schema), S-Expressions, Minimal Symbolic Syntax.
    *   *Decision Criteria:* Cross-LLM parsing reliability, efficiency (token count), simplicity, expressiveness.
*   **Data Formats for ECP Specification:** (To be determined)
    *   *Considerations:* JSON Schema for defining structure if JSON-based, EBNF or similar for formal grammar definition.

## Reference Implementations & Tooling
*   **Primary Development Languages:** (To be determined)
    *   *Likely Candidates:* Python, JavaScript (due to their prevalence in AI/ML and web development).
    *   *Purpose:* Create libraries for ECP generation, parsing, validation, and interpretation (translating ECP output to human-readable/actionable formats).
*   **Testing Frameworks for LLM Capability Analysis (Phase 1.1):** (To be determined)
    *   *Requirements:* Ability to systematically send structured inputs to various LLM APIs, capture outputs, and automate result comparison.

## Documentation & Community
*   **Project Documentation:**
    *   *Primary Platform:* GitHub (Markdown files within the repository).
    *   *Considerations for more formal/extensive documentation (Phase 4):* Sphinx, MkDocs, ReadTheDocs, GitHub Pages.
*   **Community Interaction:** (To be determined)
    *   *Initial:* GitHub Issues, Discussions.
    *   *Future Considerations:* Dedicated forum (e.g., Discourse), mailing list.

## Version Control
*   **System:** Git
*   **Platform:** GitHub

## Architectural Considerations (Future)
*   **Modularity:** Design ECP and its tooling to be modular and extensible.
*   **Layered Approach:**
    *   Core ECP: Minimal, universal specification.
    *   Utility Libraries/SDKs: Provide developer-friendly abstractions for working with ECP (input generation, output parsing/interpretation).
*   **Integration with Existing Frameworks:** (Phase 5.3)
    *   *Targets:* LangChain, LlamaIndex, and other relevant AI/LLM orchestration tools.

*(This document will be updated as technology choices are made and architectural patterns emerge.)*
