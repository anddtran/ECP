# UECP Codebase Summary & Structure

This document provides an overview of the UECP project's structure, key components, and how they interact. It will be updated as the codebase evolves.

## Current Project Structure (Documentation Phase)

As of now, the project primarily consists of documentation and planning materials.

### 1. Root Directory Files
*   **`README.md`**: The main entry point for the project. Provides a high-level overview, project goals, problem statement, proposed solution (UECP), key benefits, and a summarized roadmap.
*   **`draft.txt`**: The initial white paper outline and draft content that served as the primary source for the `README.md` and initial `cline_docs` content.

### 2. `cline_docs` Directory
This directory houses essential project management and planning documents, following the Cline custom instructions.

*   **`projectRoadmap.md`**:
    *   **Purpose:** Outlines high-level project goals, key features/milestones broken down by phases, completion criteria, and a tracker for completed tasks. This is the strategic plan for UECP development.
    *   **Interactions:** Guides the tasks listed in `currentTask.md`.
*   **`currentTask.md`**:
    *   **Purpose:** Details the current objectives, relevant context for these objectives, and specific next steps. This is the operational guide for ongoing work.
    *   **Interactions:** References `projectRoadmap.md` for alignment with broader goals. Dictates immediate actions.
*   **`techStack.md`**:
    *   **Purpose:** Documents key technology choices, architectural decisions, and tools used or planned for the project.
    *   **Interactions:** Informs development choices and provides a reference for anyone joining the project.
*   **`codebaseSummary.md`** (This file):
    *   **Purpose:** Provides a concise overview of the project structure, key components (initially documents, later code modules), their interactions, and significant changes.
    *   **Interactions:** Acts as a map to the project's organization.

### 3. `userInstructions` Directory
*(To be created when tasks requiring specific user actions arise)*
*   **Purpose:** Will contain detailed, step-by-step instructions for tasks that the user needs to perform.

## Key Components and Their Interactions (Current)
*   **`draft.txt` (Source Material)** -> feeds into -> **`README.md` (Public Overview)**
*   **`draft.txt` (Source Material)** -> informs -> **`cline_docs/projectRoadmap.md` (Strategic Plan)**
*   **`cline_docs/projectRoadmap.md`** -> guides -> **`cline_docs/currentTask.md` (Operational Plan)**
*   **`cline_docs/currentTask.md`** -> drives creation/updates of -> **Other `cline_docs` files & `README.md`**
*   **`cline_docs/techStack.md`** -> documents -> **Technical decisions for all components**
*   **`cline_docs/codebaseSummary.md`** -> describes -> **Overall project organization**

## Data Flow (Current)
*   Information flows from the initial concept (`draft.txt`) into structured planning documents (`projectRoadmap.md`, `currentTask.md`) and presentational documents (`README.md`).
*   Decisions and plans are recorded in `techStack.md` and summarized in `codebaseSummary.md`.

## External Dependencies (Current)
*   None in terms of code. The project currently relies on standard Markdown rendering (e.g., by GitHub).

## Recent Significant Changes
*   Initial creation of `README.md`.
*   Establishment of the `cline_docs` directory with `projectRoadmap.md`, `currentTask.md`, `techStack.md`, and `codebaseSummary.md`.

## User Feedback Integration and Its Impact on Development
*(Placeholder for future use. This section will track how user feedback influences project direction and feature development.)*

## Future Code Components (Placeholders)
*   **UECP Core Libraries (e.g., Python, JavaScript):**
    *   Parser for UECP syntax.
    *   Validator for UECP expressions.
    *   Generator for creating UECP expressions.
    *   Interpreter/Translator for converting UECP output to other formats.
*   **Experimental Test Harness:**
    *   Scripts/tools for sending UECP and natural language prompts to various LLM APIs.
    *   Modules for collecting and analyzing LLM responses.
*   **Sample Applications/Examples:**
    *   Demonstrations of UECP in various use cases.

*(This document will be updated significantly as code development begins and the project structure matures.)*
